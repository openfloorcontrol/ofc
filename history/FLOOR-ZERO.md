😂 Okay this is too good not to mass:

ofc run blueprint.yaml


# blueprints/neuromancer-2026.yaml
name: Gibson Writing Room
description: Mass a cyberpunk novel where the slang is real

floor: The Sprawl

agents:
  - @gibson: "William Gibson channeling 2026. Noir, 
              dense, poetic. Tech is texture, not explanation."
  - @editor: "Terse. Cuts the fat. Keeps the vibe."
  - @lore: "Tracks continuity. Names, places, slang. 
            The ofc glossary is canon."
  - @voice: "Reads dialogue aloud. Does it sound speakable?
             Would Case say this?"

rooms:
  - #writers-pit: "Where the prose gets mass'd"
  - #continuity: "Where @lore checks the timeline"

furniture:

  - glossary.md
  - timeline.md


Chapter 1: Floor Zero
The sprawl didn’t sleep, but it dreamed. Neon bled through fog,
painting the underbelly of the data stacks in fever colors.
Kai hadn’t mass’d anything real in months. Small gigs. Adapter
work. Wrapping legacy APIs for corps too cheap to rebuild. The
kind of work that paid in scrip and didn’t ask questions.
“You’re flooring tonight?” Vec pinged, her voice already in
his cochlear before he could blink.
“Got a client. Wants a full floor spun up by morning.”
“HTTP?”
“Local. In-process. They’re paranoid.”
“Paranoid pays.”
Kai jacked in. The floor materialized around him—empty,
waiting. A single agent shimmered into existence. @broker.
Chrome smile. No eyes.
“You the mass man?” @broker asked.
“I adapter. I floor. Depends on the job.”
“Tonight you mass. Full team. Seven agents. One conversation.
No leaks.”
“And if someone wants out?”
@broker’s smile didn’t waver. “[PASS] is always an option.
But nobody passes on this floor. Not twice.”
Kai felt the weight of it. Seven agents. One floor. The kind
of job that either made your name or erased it.
“ofc,” he said, and opened the session.

Should I keep going? 😂
I would mass this entire novel.
